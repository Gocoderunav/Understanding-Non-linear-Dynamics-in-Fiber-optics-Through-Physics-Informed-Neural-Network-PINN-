# Solving-Non-Linear-Schrodinger-Equation-Using-PINN-s
As we know, when light travels through nonlinear media, phenomena such as the Kerr effect alter the pulse evolution. To understand how light pulse propagation changes, we use the famous equation known as the Non-Linear Schr√∂dinger Equation (NLSE). The NLSE is a nonlinear partial differential equation with no analytical solution. Solving it requires an advanced understanding of mathematics and computational techniques. One common method to solve the NLSE is the Split-Step Fourier Method (SSFM). In this study, I have attempted to solve the NLSE using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) require less data compared to traditional neural networks. In our approach, we use the initial pulse as a constraint and ensure that the initial and boundary conditions of the wave are satisfied by the predicted neural network. The loss function of a PINN is designed to minimize both the governing equations of physics and the boundary conditions. This way, the PINN effectively integrates physical laws into the learning process, leading to accurate predictions with fewer data requirements.
